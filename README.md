Run PHP Code
============

<a href="https://github.com/websiteduck/Run-PHP-Code/archive/master.zip"><b>Download Run PHP Code</b></a>

This script gives you the ability to quickly test snippets of PHP code locally. A local apache server is required.

- Create a folder called <b>php</b> or similar in your www folder. 
- Extract the Run PHP Code files into it. 
- Bookmark the URL for easy access.
- Bonus points for cloning the repository instead and pulling once in a while.
- <b>If you get a blank screen</b> you are probably not accessing Run PHP Code from 127.0.0.1.  This is a security feature.  Add your IP address to line 13 of index.php.

<b>This application is meant to be run locally and should not be made publicly accessible.</b>
